                            Beth and Leah walked into a composition class at Hawkeye Community College, simply expecting to fulfill a requirement of knowing where to put commas in sentences. But they left with so much more: a lifelong friendship and proper knowledge of preposition usage (Leah's grammar is still in question). Beth and Leah quickly became not just good friends, but they were like a sister to each other. That was good for Leah, who never had a sister growing up. Unless you count Dan. Which, of course, she doesn’t. One story best displays Leah and Beth’s level of friendship. They became roommates and had a very nice apartment on campus. Such a nice place, the 80 degrees they had it set to was spent heating the upstairs apartments. So, they naturally would go park Beth’s car in the sun and just sit in there to keep warm. If you’re sitting with someone in a car, parked in the sun just to keep warm, pretty good chance you really like that person. When they weren’t sitting in a car together, Leah and Beth frequently ate at Carlos O’Kelly’s or ordering Red Apple Chinese (Beth's favorite). They’ve remained close over the past 12 years and most of their time together these days is spent chasing around Beth’s kids. Leah, or Aunt Leah as the kids call her, always enjoys that time spent together as a group.

                            Leah and Danielle have been friends since being kindergarten students. Good luck beating that duration of friendship. Leah and Danielle met each other on the school bus. And judging by the location of Leah’s childhood home, it was a good thing she found someone to talk with on those rides to school. And apparently they lucked out with a bus driver that didn’t care too much about what they did during those rides. According to Leah, they would share cookie dough out of a tub, play music on a small keyboard that Danielle would bring, and smell lip smackers chapstick and try to guess the scent. Summary of that story: they probably had way more fun on their bus rides than most everyone else reading these words. They somewhat drifted apart during high school but reunited in college and Leah couldn’t be happier that they became best of friends once again. Leah is also happy Danielle and her family moved back to the area, probably hoping to once again rock out on that keyboard while eating cookie dough.

                            They’re friends that met in high school through Alyssa’s siblings, who were in Leah’s grade. But they’re pretty much sisters from different misters. Leah and Alyssa realize they have pretty similar personalities, and others have told them they even look alike. They spend their time together laughing at themselves and reminiscing about all the bad decisions they’ve made throughout the years. They won’t share how many bad decisions they’ve discussed, or even better, what those mistakes were. So, the rest of us are left to wonder and just make up our own ideas. Alyssa and Leah spent a lot of time in high school driving around in Alyssa’s purple truck that she named “Barney.” It’s unclear if they consider driving around in a purple truck one of their bad past decisions. And yet another one of those bad decisions could be that Alyssa and Leah gave code names to boys they liked in high school so they could talk about them without others knowing. When she wasn’t analyzing bad decisions or talking in code, Alyssa spent a lot of her time running away from Leah’s family dog, Sandy, on their farm.

                            They've been friends since college and never lack things to talk about. Leah and Hannah are both dental hygienists, so naturally the topic of teeth often come up in conversation. And they also like talking about their pets. Presumably, they don't spend much time talking about their pets' teeth (or do they?). However, Leah and Hannah insist they don't spend that much time talking about teeth. Hannah's husband, an innocent bystander, disagrees. But their friendship does go beyond the excitement of talking about teeth. Not that it would take much but they've enjoyed the excitement of skydiving and they've pushed themselves through half-marathons, trail runs and duathlons. For those not sure, duathlons typically involve running, biking, and then more running. They apparently don't like to swim. Hannah and Leah mainly complete these physical activities for one reason: to enjoy ice cream afterwards without guilt.

                            Adam is a man of few words. So few that it only took him four words to describe the relationship he has with his brother, Adam: "We do everything together." A description that is truly rich and compelling. Because there’s some space to fill here, we will just use our imagination to fill in the void. We can assume Adam and Aaron go grab drinks together. They likely might grab a bite to eat together. Maybe they’re taking bubble baths together while watching reruns of the Golden Girls. Who knows? Leah said she knows the brothers enjoy garage tinkering, which likely means fixing things in their garage, and not fixing the garage itself. Leah also knows they enjoy fishing in Canada and snowmobiling out west. For some reason, they really enjoy snowmobiling in Colorado. Something about recent changes in the law or something. Laws that result in them wanting more snacks than usual. Apparently, they also enjoy harassing and picking on their dad. That doesn’t make them sound real nice, but OK. And Leah said they also copy each other. If Adam gets a jeep, Aaron gets a jeep. If Aaron gets a nice ice fishing hut, Adam gets a nice ice fishing hut.

                            <strong>Adam's Version:</strong>
                            <br/>
                            Joe: Known him since grade school, went to college together, go fishing and golfing together.
                            <br/>
                            Joel: Known him since middle school, go fishing and golfing together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These two will be lumped together for two reasons. First, pretty much the same description was given for both Joe and Joel. And second, Leah said she was going to use a photo of Adam, Joe and Joel all together (and his step-dad). Joe and Adam have been friends since grade school and they went to college together. They enjoy fishing and golfing together. Joel and Adam have only been friends since middle school. Not sure if they didn’t like each other in grade school or they just ignored Joel. Feel free to use that as a conversation starter at the reception. So, guess what Adam and Joel enjoy doing together? Yep, fishing and golfing. Leah also noted that the three friends grow “AWFUL” mustaches and use dye to make them look better. Leah capitalized every letter in awful to stress how, well, awful, the mustaches look. However, Leah is fond of Joe and Joel because they did their best to push Adam to propose. Of course, their best must have stunk for the most part as it took Adam almost four years to propose. Good try anyway guys.

                            Grew up in the same neighborhood, build jeeps.

                        <p>
                            Adam opened up a little more about his friendship with Tim, using eight words to describe the relationship: “Grew up in the same neighborhood. Build jeeps.” After reading that, you probably feel like you’ve known Adam and Tim your entire life. Tim was in the garage when Leah and Adam first met, gathered to drink before going out to drink some more. Leah gave a glowing remembrance of her first meeting with Tim, saying, “How I didn’t run away right then and there is beyond me.” Apparently, Adam and Tim bring out the BEST in one another when they are together. Adam and Tim used to cruise around town on mopeds back in their younger days, according to Leah. Presumably because they enjoyed doing so, and weren’t forced to do so after losing their license.
